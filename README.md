Knockout Tutorial
================
This is a collection of slides and code samples which will guide the user through building a simple, client-only application. It is a linear guide, that gradually builds up features of Knockout.

This is intended to be an hour-long presentation, it is not a "follow-along" guide.

The HTML version of the slides is [Knockout/index.html](Knockout/index.html).

The presentation and the code use a variety of images, all distributed under a variety of licenses. They are all open licenses, but I have not instituted any guarantee that I comply with these terms. So, um, don't use it yet. I will document all of the licenses required for distribution, and this product itself will likely be under the GPL (since some images are GPL).
