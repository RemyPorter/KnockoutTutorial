Knockout Tutorial
================
This is a collection of slides and code samples which will guide the user through building a simple, client-only application. It is a linear guide, that gradually builds up features of Knockout.

This is intended to be an hour-long presentation, it is not a "follow-along" guide.

The HTML version of the slides is [Knockout/index.html](Knockout/index.html).
